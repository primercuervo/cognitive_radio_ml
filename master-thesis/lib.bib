abstract = {We introduce a novel physical layer scheme for single user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications based on unsupervised deep learning using an autoencoder. This method extends prior work on the joint optimization of physical layer representation and encoding and decoding processes as a single end-to-end task by expanding transmitter and receivers to the multi-antenna case. We introduce a widely used domain appropriate wireless channel impairment model (Rayleigh fading channel), into the autoencoder optimization problem in order to directly learn a system which optimizes for it. We considered both spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing techniques in our implementation. Our deep learning-based approach demonstrates significant potential for learning schemes which approach and exceed the performance of the methods which are widely used in existing wireless MIMO systems. We discuss how the proposed scheme can be easily adapted for open-loop and closed-loop operation in spatial diversity and multiplexing modes and extended use with only compact binary channel state information (CSI) as feedback.},

abstract = {We present and discuss several novel applications of deep learning for the physical layer. By interpreting a communications system as an autoencoder, we develop a fundamental new way to think about communications system design as an end-to-end reconstruction task that seeks to jointly optimize transmitter and receiver components in a single process. We show how this idea can be extended to networks of multiple transmitters and receivers and present the concept of radio transformer networks as a means to incorporate expert domain knowledge in the machine learning model. Lastly, we demonstrate the application of convolutional neural networks on raw IQ samples for modulation classification which achieves competitive accuracy with respect to traditional schemes relying on expert features. The paper is concluded with a discussion of open challenges and areas for future investigation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.This paper studies the problem of resource allocation in overlay systems. A multiple-input single-output (MISO) primary link shares the spectrum with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secondary link, which in return acts as an amplify-And-forward (AF) relay, forwarding the primary message. The considered problem is the maximization of the secondary energy efficiency (EE) subject to a primary rate requirement. The resulting optimization problem is a fractional program which can not be tackled by traditional fractional optimization methods. Two algorithms are proposed, based on an interplay between fractional programming and sequential optimization theory, which trade-off performance and complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms both in terms of energy-efficient performance and complexity.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio is viewed as a novel approach for improving the utilization of a precious natural resource: the radio electromagnetic spectrum. The cognitive radio, built on a software-defined radio, is defined as an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its environment and uses the methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and adapt to statistical variations in the input stimuli, with two primary objectives in mind: {\textperiodcentered} highly reliable communication whenever and wherever needed; {\textperiodcentered} efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. Following the discussion of interference temperature as a new metric for the quantification and management of interference, the paper addresses three fundamental cognitive tasks. 1) Radio-scene analysis. 2) Channel-state estimation and predictive modeling. 3) Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management. This work also discusses the emergent behavior of cognitive radio.},

Data mining is a fast growing application area in business. Machine learning techniques are used for data analysis and pattern discovery and thus can play a key role in the development of data mining applications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in the context of business is useful in selecting an appropriate method for a specific application. The paper, therefore, provides an overview of machine learning techniques and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in the context of mining business data. A survey of data mining applications in business is provided to investigate the use of learning techniques. Rule induction (RI) was found to be most popular, followed by neural networks (NNs) and case-based reasoning (CBR). Most applications were found in financial areas, where prediction of the future was a dominant task category. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Feature interactions (FIs, in short) occur when features of different communication services interfere with each other. The FI filtering is a pre-processing before the FI detection, which roughly identifies FI-prone service combinations based on simple indications of the FIs. We have previously proposed an FI filtering method at requirements stage using Use Case Maps (UCMs). This method identifies FI-prone service combinations by focusing on changes in user's scenarios before/after the service composition, but does not tell which scenarios in the compound services have a potential of FIs.In this paper, as an extension of the previous method, we propose a new method to derive FI-prone scenarios from the FI-prone combinations obtained by the previous method. From many practical FIs, we first make the following two observations: (a) FI tends to occur in scenarios where both services are activated, and (b) FI tends to occur in scenarios where a service bypasses a feature of the other service. Then, based on the observations, we propose heuristics on the UCM scenario paths to derive FI-prone scenarios. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the derived scenarios successfully cover all scenarios that lead to actual FIs.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate-everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments. ?? 1991.},

Although I have tried to eliminate errors, some un- doubtedly remain—caveat lector. Many typographical infelicities will no doubt me have your suggestions about topics that are too important to be left out. I hope that future versions will cover Hopfield nets, Elman nets and other re- current nets, radial basis functions, grammar and automata learning, genetic algorithms, and Bayes networks . . .. I am also collecting exercises and project suggestions which will appear in future versions. My intention is to pursue a middle ground between a theoretical textbook and one that focusses on applications. The book concentrates on the important ideas in machine learning. I do not give proofs of many of the theorems that I state, but I do give plausibility arguments and citations to formal proofs. And, I do not treat many matters that would be of practical importance in applications; the book is not a handbook of machine learning practice. Instead, my goal is to give the reader sufficient preparation to make the extensive literature on machine learning accessible. Students in my Stanford courses on machine learning have already made several useful suggestions, as have my colleague, Pat Langley, and my teaching assistants, Ron Kohavi, Karl Pfleger, Robert Allen, and Lise Getoor. persist until the final version.

@article{Mitola2000,
abstract = {This dissertation addresses the intersection of personal wireless technology and computational intelligence. The primary research issue addressed is the organization of radio domain knowledge into data structures processable in real-time that integrate machine learning and natural language processing technology into software radio. The thesis defines and develops the cognitive radio architecture. The features needed in the architecture are derived from cognitive radio use cases. These include inferring user communications context, shaping accessnetwork demand, and realizing a protocol for real-time radio spectrum rental. Mathematical foundations for the knowledge-representation architecture are derived by applying point-set topology to the requirements of the use cases. This results in the set-theoretic ontology of radio knowledge defined in the Radio Knowledge Representation Language (RKRL). The mathematical analysis also demonstrates that isochronous radio software is not Turingcomputable. Instead, it is constrained to a bounded-recursive subset of the total functions. A rapid-prototype cognitive radio, CR1, was developed to apply these mathematical foundations in a simulated environment. CR1 demonstrated the principles of cognitive radio and focused the research issues. This led to an important contribution of this dissertation, the cognitive radio architecture. This is an open architecture framework for integrating agent-based control, natural language processing, and machine learning technology into software-defined radio platforms.},

The language is very simple and the math elementary. Students and researchers in universities or practitioners who are interested in gaining an intuition into the logic behind OFDM-OQAM will hopefully enjoy reading this text. On the other hand, those interested in a quick understanding of the idea, just enough to start using the waveform, can find far better material.},

abstract = {The paper provides an overview of the development of intelligent data analysis in medicine from a machine learning perspective: a historical view, a state-of-the-art view, and a view on some future trends in this subfield of applied artificial intelligence. The paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview but rather describes some subareas and directions which from my personal point of view seem to be important for applying machine learning in medical diagnosis. In the historical overview, I emphasize the naive Bayesian classifier, neural networks and decision trees. I present a comparison of some state-of-the-art systems, representatives from each branch of machine learning, when applied to several medical diagnostic tasks. The future trends are illustrated by two case studies. The first describes a recently developed method for dealing with reliability of decisions of classifiers, which seems to be promising for intelligent data analysis in medicine. The second describes an approach to using machine learning in order to verify some unexplained phenomena from complementary medicine, which is not (yet) approved by the orthodox medical community but could in the future play an important role in overall medical diagnosis and treatment.

abstract = {Machines might physically interact with humans more smoothly if we better understood the subtlety of human- human physical interaction. We recently reported that two people working cooperatively on a physical task will quickly negotiate an emergent strategy: typically subjects formed a temporal specialization such that one member commands the early parts of motion and the other the late parts [1]. In our current study, we replaced one of the humans with a robot programmed to perform one of the typical human specialized roles. We expected the remaining human to adopt the complementary specialized role. Subjects did believe that they were interacting with another human but did not adopt a specialized behavior as subjects would when physically working with another human; our negative result suggests a very subtle negotiation takes place in human-human physical interaction.},

@article{Zhai2013,
abstract = {A spectrum sharing scheme is proposed for overlaid wireless networks based on the decode-and-forward two-path successive relaying technique. In this scheme, two secondary transmitters are used to transmit secondary information alternately to their respective receivers while relaying the primary signal at the same time. The transmission of the primary system is continuous, and the secondary system can opportunistically help the primary transmission in exchange for the spectrum sharing. Superposition coding is used at the secondary transmitters, where the primary signal and secondary signal are linearly combined. Successive interference decoding and cancelation is performed by secondary users to extract their desired signals. For the primary system, joint decoding is performed by treating the secondary signal as noise at the receiver side. The optimal power allocation is determined to maximize the success probability of the secondary system without violating the outage performance of the primary system. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can conservatively protect the primary performance while realizing the secondary transmission requirement.},

The main engine behind the program combines machine learning approaches with a technique called Monte Carlo tree search.
